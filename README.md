# Bob Greenhands

A small game made to look and feel like old gardening simulators of the early 21st century.

## About the game

This game is supposed to look and feel like gardening simulators of the early 2000s, specifically the [Alice Greenfingers](https://www.alicegreenfingers.com/) series (which is also inspiration for the name of the game), while also adding more features and more fun elements into the game.
This game is in no way an official successor the the Alice Greenfingers series, I'm also not affiliated with Arcade Lab.

## Is the game already finished?

Hell no, it's still in very early developement and while you can """play""" it, right now there is not much besides planting strawberries and watch them grow and moving the main character, Bob, around.

## Requirements and supported architectures/operating systems

To run this game, you need an x64 processor (it might run on x86, it might run on ARM, but I really can't be bothered to also support those architectures, feel free to mess around with it though), a graphics card preferably from this century and around a hundred megabytes of storage. If your computer manages to run Windows 10 (or even Windows 7) or any modern GNU/Linux distribution, the game should run.
You also need [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) or higher installed on your device.

.NET Core also supports BSD and macOS but I can't guarantee support for both operating systems as I don't have an Apple device (and don't plan on either buying one or breaking Apple's EULA) nor any kind of BSD installed.

**TL;DR:**

Requirements:

- [.NET Core Runtime 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) or higher if you have a prebuilt version of the game
- [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (includes the Runtime) or higher for building the game
- ``cmake``, ``make`` and ``gcc`` for building FNA3D on GNU/Linux and macOS.
- ``faudio``
- ``libsdl2``
- Visual Studio 2010 for building FNA3D (a core component) on Windows - **[read more](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D/blob/master/visualc/README)**

Fully supported operating systems and architectures:

- any modern GNU/Linux system
- Windows 7 or higher
- any x64 capable processors
- any somewhat modern GPU capable of doing 2D graphics
- any sound device that works with your operating system

Partially supported operating systems and architectures (it might work, it might not, but making it work is definitely not a priority):

- macOS 10.13 or higher
- any form of BSD
- any processor not supporting the x64 instruction set (i. e. old 32-bit processors, ARM processors)

## Building and running the game

**Right now you have to build FNA3D yourself on Windows until I've figured out how to build it via Windows' command prompt! Read more [here](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D/blob/master/visualc/README).**

**Do NOT download this repository via GitHub's green "â¤“ Code" button, since this will not download the game's dependencies!**

1. Install the necessary requirements listed above.
2. Clone the repository **recursively** with ``git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ManicRobot/bobgreenhands.git``.
3. Navigate into the newly created folder ``bobgreenhands``.
4. If you're on Windows: Find out how to build FNA3D [here](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D/blob/master/visualc/README) and build it accordingly in Nez\\Modules\\FNA3D. If you're on GNU/Linux or macOS: Run ``bash build.sh`` in your favorite terminal and wait till it's done.
5. Navigate into ``BobGreenhands`` (``BobGreenhands`` is a subfolder within ``bobgreenhands``, notice the different capitalization).
6. Run ``dotnet run`` in your command prompt/terminal and enjoy. :)

## Reporting bugs

You found a bug in the game or your game crashed? Report it by opening an issue! Navigate to the "Issues" tab on top of the page and click the green "New issue" button. Be sure to include crash reports and savegames (if available) in the issue so I can fix it faster. While you're there, if you have suggestions or ideas for the game, you can open another issue for that too.
